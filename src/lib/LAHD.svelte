<h2>MY ROLE</h2>

<p>
    I work across the full stack using C#, .NET, Razor Pages, Blazor Server, and ServiceNow to build ITSM and
    administrative systems that support complex, data-driven workflows. My work typically spans
    backend services, UI development, and database integration, with a focus on reliability,
    maintainability, and performance.
</p>

<p>
    I regularly use SQL Server and SSMS for advanced querying, reporting datasets, and performance
    tuning, and I build reporting and analytics solutions using Power BI and SSRS to support
    operational and management decision-making.
</p>

<h2>MY WORK</h2>

<p>
    More specifically, I specialize in creating secure, role-based user portals that guide users
    through multi-step business processes such as applications, reviews, approvals, and document
    management. These portals are designed with usability in mind and often include dynamic forms,
    conditional logic, validation, and integrations with downstream systems.
</p>

<p>
    I have experience working within large, enterprise environments and established architectures
    (e.g., Clean Architecture, CQRS/MediatR), and I focus on writing clean, scalable code that can be
    extended as business requirements evolve.
