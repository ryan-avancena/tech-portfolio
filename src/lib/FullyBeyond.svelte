<h4>WHAT IS A DESIGNATHON?</h4>

<p>
    A designathon is an intensive, creativity-driven event where participants collaborate to ideate, design, and prototype solutions within a limited timeframe. 
    Unlike a hackathon, which focuses heavily on coding, a designathon emphasizes design, user experience, and storytelling— making it accessible to creators of all skill levels.
