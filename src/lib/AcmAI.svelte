<h1>ASSOCIATION OF COMPUTING MACHINERY - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE LEAD</h1>

<h3><i>lead the artificial intelligence / data science / machine learning branch of CSUF's largest tech club </i></h3>

<p>
    During my time as the Artificial Intelligence Lead for ACM, a team of 8-10 members and I collaborated to 
    create educational and interactive workshops for 30+ students every Tuesday.
</p>

<p>These workshops would cover beginner to intermediate topics in AI such as 
    Introduction to Data Science, Machine Learning Algorithms (Regression and Classification),
    Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Transformers.
</p>

<p>
    We emphasized accessibility and clarity by breaking down complex concepts into intuitive examples,
    supported by live code-alongs, visualizations, and open discussion during each session.
</p>

<p>
    Workshops featured live code-alongs in Python using libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn,
    PyTorch, and Hugging Face, along with take-home notebooks and resources for continued learning.
